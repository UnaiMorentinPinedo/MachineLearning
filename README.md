# MachineLearning

Machine learning techniques implemented in C++. In this repo there can be found different Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning and Reinforcement Learning techniques. All implementations listed below can be found in their respective folder in the repo.



## Clustering

Implementation covers unsupervised learning techniques. Specially, two clustering algorithms: KMeans and Fuzzy C Means. Which can be used to create clusters for mall customer and iris types (for example).

## Isolation Forest

Implementation of an unsupervised learning algorithm. The isolation forest anomaly detection algorithm.

## Decision Tree

Implementation of a decision tree algorithm called ID3, based on information gain.

## Markov Chain & MDP

Implementation covers reinforcement learning techniques. Specially two related algorithms: Markov Chain and Markov Decision Process. Which can be used on different grid environments.

## Neural Network

Implementation covers an artificial neural network. Which can  be used to predict the value of a handwritten numbers (for example).

## Regression

Implementation of a supervised learning regression model. Which can be used to predict the prices of a house per square meter (for example).
